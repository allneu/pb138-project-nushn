# PB138 - Project Nushn

## Main description

The page will serve as a better todolist (you can take inspiration from notion.so). There will be a menu on the page that will allow the user to switch between subpages. Each subpage can have its own icon and at least two types of views (list view, where items are in a list, and board view, where items can be moved between columns marked with labels like "done" or "todo"). A subpage in list view can display items either as a classic "bullet list" or as a checked list with checkboxes. It is also possible to add images. Each list item can be moved arbitrarily up and down within the list. For each page it is possible to see who made the last edit and when.

## Must have:

* the database must contain at least 4 entities
* responsive design
* register, log in, log out
* add, remove an entry, change its content and change its label
* change the order of items in the list
* have a list of your todo sheets
* share a todo list with another user
